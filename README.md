# Life_expectancy_gdp_project
In this project, we will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

**The main goal of the project** is to assess the effect of economic development on the level of life expectancy.
